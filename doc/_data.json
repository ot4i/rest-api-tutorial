These services help you define and implement a RESTful service based on the existing Swagger document. These services, which can be invoked from other standard REST or HTTP clients, allow you to send REST requests and receive responses over HTTP. This tutorial shows a simple example where a REST API service implements several functions to query and manage a sample customer registry."},

In this example, the REST API defines five operations. Each operation can be invoked by a unique combination of the URL path and HTTP method. An operation can make use of a JSON input object and URL parameters. The operations are implemented as subflows that use different transformation nodes. The nodes demonstrate how you can use ESQL, Java, or Graphical Mapping to process an incoming JSON message. The subflows also show you how to construct a response message that includes a JSON response object. You can also generate subflows to handle errors that might occur while processing the REST requests and responses."},
